# GROQ Parser

[GROQ](https://groq.dev/) is query language which is designed to work directly on JSON documents. [GROQ](https://www.sanity.io/docs/groq) was developed by [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/docs/groq) (where itâ€™s used as the primary query language).

> GROQ is still in ALPHA.

## Using GROQ with infinity

Following example shows how to make use of GROQ inside grafana infinity datasource.

## Known limitations

- With the initial test, only works with array type of docs.
