Once the plugin installed, you need to create an instance of the datasource. To create an instance follow the steps

- Go to `http://localhost:3000/datasources` and select _Add data source_
- Search for **Infinity** plugin
- Give a name to your datasource
- Save.

This datasource can work out of the box without any additional configuration. If you need the URL to be authenticated or pass additional headers/query/tls/timeout settings, configure the corresponding section.

- Configuration will be applied to all the queries. If you need different configuration for different queries, create separate instance of infinity datasource

- If you configure the URL in the settings, the same will be prefixed along with all your queries.

> If you specify the URL as `https://example.com/path` in your datasource config and `/my-endpoint` as your url in the query, then the final URL will be `https://example.com/path/my-endpoint`

More details about the URL and related settings can be found in [url](/wiki/url) page

## Proxy outgoing requests

If you want your datasource to connect via proxy, set the environment appropriate environment variables. HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY. HTTPS_PROXY takes precedence over HTTP_PROXY for https requests.

> proxy support is available from v0.7.10
